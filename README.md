# Hands-On Machine Learning



This is some of the projects I work on as I follow Aurelien Geron's *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow*. You can get yourself a copy of the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291). 

The following are the files and their descriptions (they are added as I progress through the book):

- MachineLearningQuestions.md - Answers basic questions about Machine Learning. These appear at the end of Chapter 1.
