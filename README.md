# Hands-On Machine Learning

This is some of the projects I work on as I follow Aurelien Geron's *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow*. You can get yourself a copy of the book [here](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291). 

The following are the files and their descriptions (they are added as I progress through the book):

- [MachineLearningQuestions.md](https://github.com/youngjeong46/hands-on-machine-learning/blob/master/MachineLearningQuestions.md) - Answers basic questions about Machine Learning. These appear at the end of Chapter 1.
- [End-to-end-project - Housing](https://github.com/youngjeong46/hands-on-machine-learning/tree/master/Housing.ipynb) - A Machine Learning project on predicting California housing price based on the StatLib library. It is a full-on project that goes through framing the problem, analyzing data, using regression algorithms on the training data, evaulating algorithm performance, and then testing it on the test data. Also looks into pipelining the project.
- [Classification](https://github.com/youngjeong46/hands-on-machine-learning/tree/master/classification.ipynb) - Since the first project was on the regression, this one looks at the other supervised learning task, classification. MNIST data on various digits are examined to correctly predict the right number. Many types of classification, including single binary, multiclass, multilabel and multioutput classifications are examined.
